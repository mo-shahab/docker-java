going public, the eclipse native code needs to be more generic, help me with
that

most of the generic instances where one can use docker with java: 
 - hosting containerized servers
 - building microservices in java, using docker-compose
 - springboot instances

also:
 - hosting httpd, using apache httpd
 - hosting containerized nginx servers
 - and such

an important thing to note, in the usecase no 5 ( in the repo as ->
<name-of-the-usecase> - <number-of-the-usecase)
 - the tommcat version is one upped, for tomcat 7 its 8 and for tomcat 8 its 9
 - same with the jdk's too, jdk 7 was supposed to be built on tomcat 7 but jdk7 was not an
   installation candidat for ubuntu 16, so i had to change the other docker image with jdk 8 and tomcat 8
   but this would bring in conflicts with our intentions, the other docker file has tomcat 9 and jdk 9

the stuff that i refered to had, was working with lot of outdated dependencies, so the changes
